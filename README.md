# Amplified-Ecosystem-SoundToVibration

Arduino test code for creating correlation between sound sensor input and haptic buzzer output

Haptic buzzer test code originates from adafruit/Adafruit_DRV2605_Library

As of 01/06/25 the correlation only effects the rate of the vibration effect played on the buzzer but still a live response to sound input
